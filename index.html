My name is Samuel Hailu Alazar. I am <strong>Eritrean</strong>. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea">Eritrea</a> is located in the horn of <a href="https://www.google.ch/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=horon+africa&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=TWrdVsbsJqjC8gf_iaDgDw#channel=fs&q=horn+africa"> Africa </a>
. I was born in a town called <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekemhare">Dekemhare</a>. A town which was built during the time of Italian colonization.	   
I started in <em>St.Jacob Catholic Elementary school</em>. When I finished my fifth grade we had to move
to Asamara which is the capital city of Eritrea. The reason why we moved there was to find a better chance 
of education. Things went well as we planned,I was able to find a better classes and a better life. when I finished my High-school it was 
an obligation for to complete my National-service which I totally disagree. But there was no way  that I could refuse back then.
So i joined the military camp which is located at the northern part of Eritrea. a place known as Sawa.after almost on year, the military treatment,the harsh type of climate,the  shortage
food and the torture got worst and worst. Sudan was located few miles away from the military camp. It is only 3 to 6 days by foot,there was no other choice
the only choice was to cross the boarder. Me and my friend decided to cross the boarder,even though it was too dangerous for us. finally we made it to Sudan.I stayed there for almost 2 years
and then I came to Switzerland as an asylum seeker. I could say I found a better life because, what I have when was back home was the best If it 
was not for the military. but found hope here, a hope that i could achieve my studies. After I came to Switzerland I start to learn the language,and started to work for the Company called  <a href="http://www.ungleich.ch/" >ungleich GmbH</a>.
